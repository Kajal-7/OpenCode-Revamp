# OpenCode Revamp

> ***Website design*** is an extremely crucial aspect as it determines the very first impression we make on our audience. It impacts how our audience perceives us and this impression can either get them to remain on our page or leave it. 
Through this repository, you will be able to revamp and redesign certain sections of the OpenCode website and use your design skills and instincts to transform these sections and improve the User Interface.
