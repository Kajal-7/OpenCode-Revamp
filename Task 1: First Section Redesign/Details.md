## Task 1: First Section Redesign
The submission duration for this task has begun ðŸŽ‰
This issue is OPEN TO ALL. 
No need to claim this issue.
NO SUBMISSION WILL BE ACCEPTED AFTER 7th October 11:59 PM.

This is our OpenCode Website: [https://opencodeiiita.github.io/](https://opencodeiiita.github.io/)

Your first task is to redesign the footer section of the website. The only constraint is the original info should be contained on your redesigned footer. Apart from that, there is no rule! You have complete design freedom, showcase your creativity, and improve this section ðŸ™‚

The task needs to be done in Figma. Figma is free to use and downloading it is also optional. You can use the browser version of Figma in case you don't want to download it. If you are unclear on how to use it, check the tutorial here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2o9CIdL6Q0&list=PLDtHAiqIa4wa5MBbE_XDoqY51sAkQnkjt&index=21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2o9CIdL6Q0&list=PLDtHAiqIa4wa5MBbE_XDoqY51sAkQnkjt&index=21)

**Procedure:**

1. The color scheme should remain the same, if you are changing it, it should go well with the rest of the website.
2. The original information needs to be present in the redesigned footer. You can add any new information which you feel should be present
3. Create the footer in a Figma file and export it as png. Create PR by submitting the PNG in Task 1: First Section Redesign folder ONLY.

**MDC (Minimum Design Criteria)**:

The footer should obviously look like a footer and not like any other section of the website. The changes made to the folder must be significant.
